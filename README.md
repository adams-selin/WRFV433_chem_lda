## LDA version

This is WRF-Chem v4.3.3 with LDA included. It was created by Nicholas Heath (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0328-4398) and includes additions from Becky Adams-Selin. See Heath et al. (2016, JAMES) for documentation. This specific code has been uploaded to Zenodo and can be cited via the following DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/580444322.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13240519)

Becky has added a branch to write out entrainment data from KF. That is the output_entrainment branch.
